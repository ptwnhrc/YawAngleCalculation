With the motion data (including acceleration and rotational speed data) collected from the 3D gyroscope in the mobile phone, 
the motion dynamics of the car where the mobile phone is located can be extracted.  
The acquisition of these motion data will make up for the problem of driving track recording and prediction when the GPS signal is blocked in tunnels, underpasses, garages, etc.
